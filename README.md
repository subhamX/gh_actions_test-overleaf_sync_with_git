# gh actions test [@subhamX/overleaf_sync_with_git](https://github.com/subhamX/overleaf_sync_with_git)
This repo is solely to test [@subhamX/overleaf_sync_with_git](https://github.com/subhamX/overleaf_sync_with_git) github action!

**We were able to verify the hypothesis that "Overleaf doesn't expire credentials and ask users to force login after sometime".** Workflow has been disabled now! The insights generated from this actions testing can be read at [this link](https://github.com/subhamX/overleaf_sync_with_git/pull/4#issuecomment-1355116634).

~I've no intention to waste these precious computing resources. Although it's free for me, it's not free for this planet. We shall terminate this action run as soon as we're done with the insights.~ 



Feel free to star the original repo, if you liked it. ðŸ™‚
